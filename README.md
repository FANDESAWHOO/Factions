# HCFactions

Factions is a lightweight fork of DoctorDark’s well-known iHCF core, focused exclusively on the core factions system.
Designed for flexibility, it works out of the box on Spigot servers and is suitable for all types of gameplay — from HCF
to Survival and Semi-HCF setups.

This project does not include the full iHCF core. Instead, it offers the essential factions features, such as:

Creating and managing factions

Inviting and removing members

Basic claiming system

Cross-version compatibility (planned)

Our goal is to provide a clean, modular, and easy-to-integrate factions system that can fit into any server environment.
