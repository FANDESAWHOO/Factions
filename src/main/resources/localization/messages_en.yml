#
#   1) COLOR CODES are supported with the '&' character.
#      - For usage, see http://minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Formatting_codes
#      - When you use them, place quotes around the message like this: "Hello &cworld."
#       - To use HEX colors, use #123456 syntax: "Hello #123456world."
#
#   2) TO HIDE any message, set it to 'none'.
#
#   3) For UNICODE CHARACTERS (smileys, symbols, ..), save the file in UTF-8 encoding. See
#      - https://github.com/${author}/${project.name}/wiki/Use-Right-Encoding
#
#   4) JSON is supported. Prepend the message with [JSON].
#
#   5) JAVASCRIPT NOTICE: Some of our messages are just-in-time compiled with JavaScript.
#      Those typically have variables such as "self" inside of them. IF YOU CANNOT CODE
#      in JavaScript, be extra careful and do not remove () brackets or the variables!
